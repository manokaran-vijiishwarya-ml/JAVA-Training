An abstract class in Java:

Is declared with the abstract keyword.

Cannot create objects directly.

Can contain abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).

Acts as a base template for other classes.


When to use:

You want to provide some logic, but force subclasses to complete it.

You want multiple subclasses to inherit common code.
