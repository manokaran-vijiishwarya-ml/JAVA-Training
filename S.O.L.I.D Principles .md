S - SINGLE RESPONSIBLITY PRINCIPLE => A class should have one and only one reason to change.

O - OPEN / CLOSE PRINCIPLE => Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. (i.e) Add new function should not modify the existing code.

L - LISKOV SUBSTITUITION PRINCIPLE => Parent class feature inherits in child class should not change the parent class behaviour.

I - INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE => Should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

D - DEPENDENCY INJECTION => High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
